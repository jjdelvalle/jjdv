Started my internship and things are exciting and confusing! I'll be working with the [Alexa AI team](https://www.amazon.science/research-areas/conversational-ai-natural-language-processing).

To provide some context, the LCT program requires that we do an internship before completing the program. I took advantage of this and simply decided to apply to various top companies, and ended up going with Amazon as my destination for my internship. I will be in Aachen, Germany for the duration of my internship and then I will be moving on to Saarbr√ºcken to continue my Master's program.

Will be providing more news and my overall thoughts about the internship as I go along. Very excited!
