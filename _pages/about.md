NLP Master's student doing the Erasmus Mundus Language and Communication Technologies program, expected graduation in 2023.

I studied Software Engineering at Universidad Galileo in Guatemala City. While I was a student I worked as a full-stack web developer and a webmaster. Additionally, I also learned German during that time, which made me discover my love for linguistics and languages. This got me very interested in NLP and Deep Learning in general. This in turn, motivated me to apply for NLP graduate programs.

After finishing my Bachelor's, I worked as a Data Scientist at a software provider for financial institutions for a few years and as a Data Scientist at a company in the advertising and healthcare industry. After that, I started graduate school.
Additionally, I've finished a specialization from [deeplearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noreferrer"} on Coursera.

My hobbies include photography, playing the guitar, helping others with the GRE, and language learning.
